Miso Soup – In and Out





I don’t like to start a meal with soup. I much prefer to begin with something light, slightly acidic, and subtly bitter to get the taste buds going, and to further stimulate my appetite. Soups are usually filling, and there’s nothing worse, culinarily speaking, than...to read the rest of Chef John's article about Miso Soup please follow this link to become a member.)

Three Cheese Ham Involtini – How to Make “Hamelloni”

Chocolate Cereal Breakfast Bars – Better, Cheaper, and Way More Personal





When we were moving in, before the kitchen was set up, Michele and I would have a box of granola bars around for emergency snacking purposes, and while they served the purpose, every time I ate one I couldn’t help feel guilty since they’re never...to read the rest of Chef John's article about Chocolate Cereal Breakfast Bars please follow this link to become a member.)

Pepper Jack Cornbread Biscuits – Beginners Luck





Hybrid recipes are one of my favorite things to film, since they involve taking the most desirable attributes from two recipes, and somehow combining them into a new, “best of both worlds” version.

One-Pan Ground Beef Stroganoff Noodles – Helping Hamburger Help Itself





Like most people who grew up during the Golden Age of processed food, my mom bought a fair amount of pre-packaged, pre-mixed, just-add-water type meals, but when it came to pasta or noodles in a ground meat...to read the rest of Chef John's article about One-Pan Ground Beef Stroganoff Noodles please follow this link to become a member.)

Beans and Greens Tartine – Prepare to Open Face





Why call something an “open-face sandwich” when you can call it a “tartine?” The joke answer is because you want them to know what it is, which besides being funny is a fair point.

Low and Slow Prime Rib – Sorry, Method X, But We Had a Great Run
