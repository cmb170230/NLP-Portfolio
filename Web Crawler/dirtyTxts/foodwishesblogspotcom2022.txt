Blueberry Cornmeal Galette – Freestyle Wrap





There are foods that just work amazingly well with each other, and the combo of blueberry and cornmeal is a great example.

Greek Tomato Feta Fritters (Domatokeftethes) – Hard to Pronounce, Easy to Eat





There are so many great ways to enjoy fresh, sweet summer tomatoes, and much to my shock and amazement, these Greek-style fritters could be my new favorite. This is a major surprise, since I generally don’t enjoy large, hot chunks of fresh tomato in a recipe. I’m okay with them being cooked down, and disappearing into...to read the rest of Chef John's article about Greek Tomato Feta Fritters please follow this link to become a member.)

Carolina-Style “Whole Hog” Barbecue Pork without a Whole Hog – It Only Sounds Impossible





I recently watched an episode of Chef’s Table on Netflix, featuring Rodney Scott and his famous whole hog barbecue, and it left me both inspired and frustrated. I was inspired by Mr. Scott’s efforts to perpetuate this uniquely American meal, but frustrated I wasn’t going to be able to travel to South Carolina anytime soon to...to read the rest of Chef John's article about Carolina-Style “Whole Hog” Barbecue Pork please follow this link to become a member.)

Rodney Scott’s “Secret” Eastern Carolina Barbecue Sauce – Nailed It?





It’s usually a lot easier posting a copycat recipe for something when the creator has shared the ingredients and technique in various interviews, videos, and television appearances, and that was the case with Rodney Scott, and his famous Eastern Carolina style barbecue sauce.

Easy Grilled Sticky Ribs – Barbecue, Not Barbecue, Sorry, Not Sorry





I’ve always been fine with the old saying, “rules are meant to be broken,” especially culinary rules, as long as the final results come out just as good, if not better. Unfortunately, not everyone’s as liberal as I am when it comes to such deviations, with “real” barbecue pitmasters being a perfect...to read the rest of Chef John's article about Easy Grilled Sticky Ribs please follow this link to become a member.)

Armenian-Style Potato Salad – It’s Complicated (Not the Salad, the Emotions)





I really hope the following scenario never plays out, because no one should be forced to make such an impossible decision, but if I was at a cookout and told I had to choose between the grilled meat main course, and the potato salad, I would pick the later without hesitation.

Habanero Honey Sweet Corn Cake – This “Cake” Hurts So Good





The combination of sweet and spicy is nothing new when it comes to enjoying fresh summer corn, but this time we’re utilizing that incredible combo in a cake. Well, at least we’re calling it a “cake.” To be honest, that was simply the name I settled on after deciding it wasn’t really a pie, pudding, spoon bread, or custard. Plus, it was inspired by...to read the rest of Chef John's article about 7Habanero Honey Sweet Corn Cake please follow this link to become a member.)

7-Minute Salmon Piccata – Turning Dry and Chalky Into Moist and Succulent





Piccata is one of my all-time favorite pan sauces, and while it’s more commonly used for veal, pork, and chicken, it’s absolutely perfect with a quickly seared salmon filet.

Filipino-Style Barbecue Chicken – Yes, Banana Ketchup is a Thing





I’m always hesitant filming a video that requires a special ingredient that might be difficult for the average food wisher to find at the local market.

Coffee Granita – Have Your Coffee and Eat it Too





There is nothing like a glistening, icy granita on a hot summer day, and while I do enjoy the fruit-based varieties, for me the ultimate expression of this ancient Italian treat is done with coffee.
