   Chicken Leg Toast – Going Out on a Limb  

 



I’ve posted a lot of pictures to tease upcoming videos on social media in my day, to all sorts of reactions, but I don’t think I’ve ever seen a response quite as diverse as the one this Chicken Leg Toast received. I hope this doesn’t sound like an attempt to get a few more Twitter followers, but the thread that follows the picture I posted is nothing short of hilarious. Michele and I were literally laughing out loud, so if you’re in the mood for a few chuckles, maybe take a peek.



 



While I was thoroughly entertained by these comments, I was also bothered by a few that insinuated this was some sort of joke or gimmick. Not that I haven’t posted joke and/or gimmick recipes, but I always fully admit that’s what I’m doing. Believe it or not, this was carefully conceptualized, and thoughtfully executed, and I was thrilled with the result. That this came out looking like intentionally bizarre click-bait was purely coincidental. Allegedly.



 



Anyway, if you’re a fan of our Million Dollar Chicken recipe, you will understand what we’re trying to do here. Oven-roasted, savory French toast is good, but oven-roasted, savory French toast soaked with meaty juices is better. Plus, we’re feeding someone a delicious, satisfying meal with little more than a piece of bread, and a single drumstick, which is a win for any home cook. So, for all those reasons and more, I really do hope you give this a try soon. Enjoy!























Ingredients



2  chicken drumsticks


¼ cup diced carrot


¼ cup diced celery


¼ cup diced onion


2 cups chicken broth


  freshly ground black pepper to taste


1 teaspoon salt, or to taste


1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves


1 teaspoon lemon zest


  cayenne pepper to taste


⅓ cup creme fraiche or heavy cream


2 large eggs


2 thick slices day old French bread (1 to 1 1/2 inch thick)


1 tablespoon butter for browning bread, plus a teaspoon for greasing pan


2 tablespoons grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese 


For optional "Dragon Syrup"


¼ cup maple syrup


1 tablespoon Sriracha sauce


½ teaspoon cayenne pepper






Directions




Combine chicken drumsticks, carrots, onions, celery, and broth in a saucepan. Bring to a simmer over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes. Turn drumsticks over, cover, and cook for another 20 minutes.





Remove chicken and transfer to a plate. Allow to cool, wrap, and transfer into the refrigerator until needed.





Turn heat to medium-high and reduce cooking liquids in the saucepan to about 1/3 cup. Strain liquid into a mixing bowl, pressing some of the cooked vegetables through the sieve. Season gravy with black pepper, salt, thyme leaves, lemon zest, and cayenne; add creme fraiche and eggs and whisk everything together until a smooth batter forms.





Place bread in a shallow baking dish just large enough to fit the slices, and pour over the batter. Toss several times, wrap and place in the fridge for 1 hour or until almost all the batter is absorbed.





Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with foil and lightly grease with butter.





Melt butter in a small skillet over medium heat and brown bread for a few minutes per side. Transfer bread onto the prepared baking sheet.





Press one drumstick into the top of each slice of bread. Brush over any excess batter. Sprinkle with salt, dust with Parmesan cheese, and finish with a shake of cayenne.





Bake in the preheated oven until nicely browned, 30 to 35 minutes.





Mix together maple syrup, Sriracha hot sauce, and cayenne pepper in a little bowl ("dragon syrup").





Serve chicken leg toast drizzled with dragon syrup.











Chef John





   Cook's Note:  

For a completely savory dish, top chicken leg toast with a cream sauce, chicken gravy, or mushroom sauce instead of dragon syrup.
